# GTS Crypto Arbitrage

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED PROJECT - FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**
> 
> This is a historical project from ~2020 and is **no longer maintained**. Exchange APIs and market conditions have changed significantly. This code is provided as-is for educational purposes to demonstrate arbitrage detection algorithms and TypeScript patterns.

A triangular arbitrage detection and simulation tool for cryptocurrency exchanges built with TypeScript.

## 2025 Modernization Update

This project has been updated to work with current dependencies:

- **TypeScript 5.7** - Modern TypeScript with latest features
- **CCXT 4.4** - Updated to latest exchange API library
- **Node.js 18+** - Requires modern Node.js LTS
- **Updated tooling** - ESLint 9, GTS 5, latest development tools

### API Key Setup (Optional)

For **public market data** (monitoring/simulation mode), **no API keys are required**.

For **authenticated features** (if you add real trading later), use environment variables:

```bash
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_secret_here"
```

Or create a `.env` file (add to `.gitignore`):
```
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### Installation & Usage (Updated)

```bash
# Install dependencies (Node.js 18+ required)
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm start

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Check code style
npm run check

# Auto-fix style issues
npm run fix
```

### Breaking Changes from Original

- Removed `src/exchange_configs.json` - API keys now via environment variables only
- Updated all dependencies to 2025 versions
- CCXT v4 API compatibility (fee structure changes)
- Modern TypeScript 5.x features and strict mode

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

**Status**: Simulation only - Does not execute actual trades

- 📚 **Educational/Research purposes only** - Study the algorithms and logic
- 🚫 **Simulation only** - No actual trading implementation
- ⚠️ **Real arbitrage is complex** - Requires speed, capital, and often fails due to fees/slippage
- 🕰️ **APIs may be outdated** - CCXT and exchange APIs have evolved since 2020
- 📋 **No warranty** - See LICENSE file for full disclaimer
- 💡 **Theoretical profits ≠ Real profits** - Simulations don't account for execution risks

## Overview

This tool identifies triangular arbitrage opportunities on cryptocurrency exchanges and simulates potential profits. Triangular arbitrage exploits price discrepancies between three trading pairs on the same exchange.

**Important**: This is a simulation and analysis tool. It does not execute actual trades - it only calculates and displays potential arbitrage opportunities.

## What is Triangular Arbitrage?

Triangular arbitrage involves trading through three currency pairs to exploit pricing inefficiencies. For example:
1. BTC → ETH
2. ETH → USDT
3. USDT → BTC

If the exchange rates create a profitable cycle, trades could theoretically be executed to capture the difference. However, in practice, such opportunities are rare and quickly arbitraged away by high-frequency traders.

## Features

- Automated detection of triangular arbitrage opportunities
- Real-time price monitoring using CCXT library
- Chain cycle testing and validation
- Support for multiple exchanges (starting with Binance)
- Price table visualization
- Configurable connecting and value currencies

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.7
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Exchange API**: CCXT 4.4
- **Code Style**: Google TypeScript Style (GTS)
- **Dev Tools**: Nodemon for hot-reload

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- Exchange API credentials (optional, only for authenticated features)

## Configuration

The bot can be configured with:
- **Exchange name**: Which exchange to monitor (e.g., 'binance')
- **Connecting currency**: The intermediate currency (e.g., 'BTC')
- **Value currency**: The base currency for profit calculation (e.g., 'USDT')

Example configuration in `index.ts`:
```typescript
const binance = await new Exchange({ 
    name: 'binance', 
    connectingCurrency: 'BTC',
    valueCurrency: 'USDT'
}).initialize();
```

## Key Components

### Exchange Class
Handles connection to exchanges, retrieves market data, and executes trades.

### Chain Class
Represents a triangular arbitrage opportunity and calculates potential profits.

### Order Simulator
Simulates order execution to estimate actual profits after fees and slippage.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Exchange**: Connect to exchange and load all available trading pairs
2. **Build Chains**: Construct all possible triangular arbitrage paths
3. **Monitor Prices**: Continuously fetch real-time prices for all markets
4. **Detect Opportunities**: Calculate profit potential for each chain
5. **Execute Trades**: When profitable opportunity is found, execute the trade sequence

## Risk Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:
- **Execution Speed**: Arbitrage opportunities can disappear in milliseconds
- **Trading Fees**: Must account for exchange fees on all three trades
- **Slippage**: Market orders may execute at worse prices than expected
- **API Latency**: Network delays can eliminate arbitrage profits
- **Market Risk**: Prices can move against you during execution

## Development Notes

- Uses Google TypeScript Style (GTS) for consistent code formatting
- Nodemon provides hot-reload during development
- ESLint with Airbnb base configuration for code quality
- TypeScript for type safety and better IDE support

## Archive Notice

This project is archived and unmaintained. It represents a snapshot of arbitrage detection logic from ~2020. The code is preserved for educational purposes to demonstrate:
- Triangular arbitrage detection algorithms
- Chain building and cycle detection
- CCXT library integration patterns
- TypeScript financial calculations
- Order simulation logic

**Why arbitrage is difficult in practice**:
- High-frequency traders dominate with microsecond execution
- Exchange fees often eliminate theoretical profits
- Slippage and order book depth affect real execution
- Network latency matters significantly
- Capital requirements can be substantial
- Opportunities disappear within milliseconds

**For modern projects**, consider:
- Current CCXT API versions and rate limits
- WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Order book depth analysis (not just ticker prices)
- Realistic fee and slippage modeling
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Paper trading before any real attempts

**Note**: The opportunities shown by this simulator are theoretical. Real arbitrage requires sophisticated infrastructure, significant capital, and often yields much smaller profits than simulations suggest.

This is a legacy project migrated from Bitbucket. Before using in production:
- Update dependencies to latest versions
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Add comprehensive logging
- Consider using websockets instead of REST API for faster updates
- Implement circuit breakers and safety limits
